WARNINGS AND INFORMATION:

The files in this directory are made for generating the report template latex
specifically these files deal with the recsys module and the generation of its
report about statistics on the data used, partitioning used during the train of
the recommender system and the algorithm used to instantiate the recommender.

At the moment all the logic for generating the report in latex is hold by jinja
statement it means that the file used actually is recsys_template_complete.tex,
anyway the other files are still in the directory for different implementation
for the dynamic report.
