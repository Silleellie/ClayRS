The chuncks of the final report template are in this directory
and the idea when we use them will be to loop and use them as
many times as needed, but the key point it's how we are going to
loop on them, in fact for each field no matter if it is a
reppresenttation for the item or a representaion of the users we will
get the name of the field of data that is represented and for each
technique used on this data we will unify corresponding chunks of the
tempalate in order for the content analyzer to have this sequence:
