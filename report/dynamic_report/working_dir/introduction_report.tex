\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}
Recommender Systems (RS) are designed to assist users in various decision-making tasks by acquiring
information about their needs, interests, and preferences in order to personalize the user experience
based on such data.
These systems are based on paradigms that allow managing user information and processing
it to provide decision support.
In particular, two successful paradigms are Collaborative Filtering and Content-based Filtering.
In this document, we will present the results obtained using a recommendation system called \textbf{ClayRS},
a framework developed by the SWAP research group at the Department of Computer Science of the University of Bari.\\
