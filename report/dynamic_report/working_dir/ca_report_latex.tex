\section{Content Analyzer Module}\label{sec:ca}
The content analyzer module will deal with raw source document or more in general data which could be
video or audio data and give a representation of these data which will be used by the other two module.
The text data source could be represented with exogenous technique or with a specified representation
and each field given could be treated with preprocessing techniques and postprocessing technique.
In this experiment the following techniques have been used on specific field in order to achieve the
representation wanted:
